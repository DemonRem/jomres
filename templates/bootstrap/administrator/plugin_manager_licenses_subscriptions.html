	<h3>What do I get with a subscription license?</h3>
	<p>Jomres is a fully featured hotel and villa booking system which is designed to be a plugin for the Joomla and Wordpress Content Management Systems. The Core system is free and open source and can be installed through both CMS's Install From Web features.</p>
	<p>When you purchase a subscription you're buying the ability to download Jomres own plugins, which considerably extends the system's functionality. You are also buying the ability to raise support tickets in the event that you have a question that you can't find an answer for in the manual ( assuming you have purchased a license that includes support).</p>
	
	<h3>Which license should I get?</h3>

	<p>In the beginning you should get a Trial license. This will give you 14 days to install Jomres into your current Joomla or Wordpress installation and decide if it's right for you.</p>
	<p>You will need to ensure that your server can run Ioncube Loaders, if in doubt please contact your hosts. Plugins downloaded with a trial or subscription license key are not released under the GPL/MIT licenses.</p>

	<p>Licenses generally come in two flavours, Zero licenses, which do not include support, and Support licenses. Which one you purchase depends on you and whether or not you think you will need help using the system. After the 14 day time span you should know if you will need support or not.</p>

	<h3>What is the difference between a Subscription and Full license?</h3>

	<p>The first significant difference between Subscription licenses and Full licenses is that <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/subscription" target="_blank">Subscription</a> licenses are only valid while you continue making monthly payments for the service.</p>
	
	<p>The other difference is to ensure that the software is only available while your license is valid, we need to encode the Jomres Plugin Manager's scripts using <a href="https://www.jomres.net/blog/46-ioncube-encoders-jomres">Ioncube Encoders</a>. Jomres Core and all of the other plugins are not encoded.</p>
	
	<h3>Should I get a Full license or a Subscription license?</h3>

	<p>Which you should get depends very much on you.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Are you setting up a Jomres as part of your ongoing business strategy? In that case, we strongly recommend that you purchase a subscription license as this will offer long term updates and support for your installation.</li>
		<li>Are you a developer setting up a Jomres installation for a client where once the job is complete, your relationship ends? Purchase a Full license. It's ok, we wont judge you.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Whichever you choose, please be aware that our own long term strategy is to move almost completely to a subscription only model (with some exceptions). As a result, you may not be able to purchase renewals for Full licenses in the future.</p>
	
	<h3>What happens if I cancel my subscription?</h3>

	<p>Once you cancel your subscription you can no longer use the Jomres Core plugins. This means that you must uninstall the Jomres Plugin Manager plugin, and understand that plugins you have previously installed will no longer function. This includes any ASAModule plugins or pages that for example include shortcodes.</p>

	<h3>What are the Jomres Quickstarts?</h3>

	<p>The Quickstarts are copies of the Jomres Demo installations, packaged in such a way so that with only a few clicks of a button you can have an identical copy of one of our demos on your own server, ready to go. They're exceptionally popular with our regular users because they allow you to deploy a complete, self-hosted booking system on your client's server in no time at all.</p>

	<p>These are available to all Subscription license holders, and are available in both Joomla and Wordpress flavours.</p>

	<h3>Subscription Terms</h3>

	There are no long term contracts. You can cancel your subscription at any time, however our service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account.

	<h3>Commission fees!</h3>

	<p>One thing you will not find on this page is commission fees. Why? Because we don't charge them! Unlike Cloud/Hosted solutions that need to take a ( sometimes extortionate ) figure to to keep their servers up and running, Jomres is hosted on your own server. </p>

	<p>BY DOWNLOADING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, THE SUBSCRIBER CONSENTS TO ALL OF THE TERMS. IF THE SUBSCRIBER DOES NOT AGREE TO ANY OF THESE TERMS, THE SUBSCRIBER SHALL IMMEDIATELY STOP USING THE SERVICES AND / OR SOFTWARE.</p>
