	<h3>What do I get with a subscription license?</h3>
	<p>Jomres is a fully featured hotel and villa booking system which is designed to be a plugin for the Joomla and Wordpress Content Management Systems. The Core system is free and open source and can be installed through both CMS's Install From Web features.</p>
	<p>When you purchase a subscription you're buying the ability to download Jomres own plugins, which considerably extends the system's functionality. You are also buying the ability to raise support tickets in the event that you have a question that you can't find an answer for in the manual.</p>
	

	<h3>What happens if I cancel my subscription?</h3>

	<p>Once you cancel your subscription you can no longer use the Jomres Core plugins. This means that you must uninstall the Jomres Plugin Manager plugin, and understand that plugins you have previously installed will no longer function. This includes any ASAModule plugins or pages that for example include shortcodes.</p>

	<h3>What are the Jomres Quickstarts?</h3>

	<p>The Quickstarts are copies of the Jomres Demo installations, packaged in such a way so that with only a few clicks of a button you can have an identical copy of one of our demos on your own server, ready to go. They're exceptionally popular with our regular users because they allow you to deploy a complete, self-hosted booking system on your client's server in no time at all.</p>

	<p>These are available to all Subscription license holders, and are available in both Joomla and Wordpress flavours.</p>

	<h3>Subscription Terms</h3>

	<p>There are no long term contracts. You can cancel your subscription at any time, however our service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account.</p>

	<p>If you wish to cancel your subscription, then you need to visit visit your Paypal account and cancel it yourself. No exceptions will be made in this regard and if your subscription payment is automatically renewed we will assume that you have done so with your express permission.</p>

	<p>We reserve the right to refuse service or cancel your subscription and revoke software access for any reason we deem appropriate. You may not resell, share, or publish subscription credentials or access.</p>
	
	<h3>Commission fees!</h3>

	<p>One thing you will not find on this page is commission fees. Why? Because we don't charge them! Unlike Cloud/Hosted solutions that need to take a ( sometimes extortionate ) figure to keep their servers up and running, Jomres is hosted on your own server. </p>

	<p>BY DOWNLOADING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, THE SUBSCRIBER CONSENTS TO ALL OF THE TERMS. IF THE SUBSCRIBER DOES NOT AGREE TO ANY OF THESE TERMS, THE SUBSCRIBER SHALL IMMEDIATELY STOP USING THE SERVICES AND / OR SOFTWARE.</p>
