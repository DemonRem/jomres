<h1>We want to keep it simple and clear</h1> 

<p class="lead">No confusing tiers that hide the true cost of the software. Just choose the payment scheme that works best for you and you're done.</p>

<ul>
<li>Decide whether you want to pay once or monthly.</li> 
<li>Decide if you want to commit to a short or longer license.</li> 
<li>Decide if you want the insurance of support, or are you happy to go it alone?</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it, those are all the decisions you need to make. Once you have your Jomres license key, every feature and 170+ plugins for Jomres are immediately available for you to install through the plugin manager.</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">Please do <em>not</em> purchase any "Jomres Zero" license if you're not prepared to read the manual, or simply because it's the cheapest possible option. Jomres Zero licenses are intended for experienced web site developers who are on a tight budget. Jomres is a powerful system and if you purchase a Zero license you <em>will</em> need to be prepared to use the forum, the manual or your own ingenuity to answer your questions. We will <em>not</em> provide you with support when you realise you need hand-holding after installing it.</p>
<p class="alert alert-info">We offer more "Pre-purchase/pre-commitment" options than any of our competitors, because <em>we want you to be sure</em> that Jomres is right for you. Before committing to a purchase you have the option to install Jomres Core for free into any  existing installation of Joomla or Wordpress. Additionally, if you request a (free) trial license key you are able to install one of the 4 Quickstarts to experiment with. By the time you're ready to purchase you should know if you are going to need support or not.<br/> <strong>If you think you will need support, please purchase a license that includes support.</strong></p>
